# PS-PhotoRec-Sorter
PowerShell script to sort 'recup_dir' output directory from [PhotoRec](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec).

This was a quick and dirty script I wrote to sort the recovered files by file extension, as well as generate an Excel version of the 'report.xml' for ease of viewing. The script is provided as-is with no warranty. It is recommended to backup the files and folders before running this script.

Place `PS-PhotoRec-Sorter.ps1` into the parent directory of 'recup_dir' and run.
